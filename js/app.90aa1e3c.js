As a company that’s passionate about exposing more players to the pleasures of making music, Taylor isn’t content to see people throw in the towel before they have a chance to get their groove on. The Academy Series represents Taylor’s effort to support the development of the entry-level guitar player. Taylor believes that in many respects a player who is just beginning deserves the best-playing guitar. Most newcomers to the instrument — and parents buying for their kids — are understandably reluctant to pony up for a more expensive, “nice” brand of guitar without knowing whether the interest will last. So the approach tends to be: start with an inexpensive, “good-enough” guitar, and if things progress, upgrade to something better. But all too often this ends in hand-wringing frustration, where would-be music-makers walk away from the instrument blaming themselves for not having enough musical talent or physical dexterity, when in fact the real culprit all along was the guitar."},{itemId:"62",brand:"Martin",model:"LX1E",color:"Natural",price:"829.00",image:a("3bba"),description:"While the LX1E Little Martin is their smallest guitar, it is very big on tone, quality and versatility.

Acoustically, this solid spruce-topped guitar offers all the chiming resonance you expect from a great 12-string. Scalloped bracing is thinner than more conventional bracing. That means that the bracing pattern inside the guitar uses less wood, which means that soundboard mass is reduced. This lets the top resonate more freely, resulting in better tone with more nuance and greater projection. A Fishman Isys III pickup/preamp system gives the Villager 12-String peerless amplified performance, with a variety of onboard controls and no compromise whatsoever on pure, rich and resonant acoustic tone.

The Academy Series represents Taylor’s effort to support the development of the entry-level guitar player. Taylor believes that in many respects a player who is just beginning deserves the best-playing guitar. Most newcomers to the instrument — and parents buying for their kids — are understandably reluctant to pony up for a more expensive, “nice” brand of guitar without knowing whether the interest will last. So the approach tends to be: start with an inexpensive, “good-enough” guitar, and if things progress, upgrade to something better.

Originally introduced in 1965, today's Villager 12-String has been updated for the modern player's needs with a gloss black finish, comfortable cutaway Newporter shape and high-quality Fishman electronics. Acoustically, this solid spruce-topped guitar offers all the chiming resonance you expect from a great 12-string. Scalloped bracing is thinner than more conventional bracing. That means that the bracing pattern inside the guitar uses less wood, which means that soundboard mass is reduced. This lets the top resonate more freely, resulting in better tone with more nuance and greater projection. A Fishman Isys III pickup/preamp system gives the Villager 12-String peerless amplified performance, with a variety of onboard controls and no compromise whatsoever on pure, rich and resonant acoustic tone. The built-in tuner is conveniently placed right where you can see it, helping to keep your intonation right on the money."},{itemId:"64",brand:"Gibson",model:"Love Dove",color:"Cherry Sunburts",price:"5,349.00",image:a("19e0"),description:"Gibson collaborated with Frank Hannon—guitarist, songwriter and co-founder of the multi-platinum band Tesla—to build a highly customized signature Dove model.

Designed specifically for use with acoustic instruments, the all-analog Fender Smolder Acoustic Overdrive elegantly solves these issues with Fender know-how. To soften the bright attack of a piezo pickup Fender included a Pickup Compensation control that smooths out the highs. The Drive knob controls the amount of distortion, while 3-band EQ and Filter controls let you shape your sound to taste. We even included cabinet simulation to add some flavor when plugged into a full-range acoustic amp or PA. Designed by Fender's in-house team of experts, the Smolder Acoustic Overdrive is an all-original Fender circuit. The chassis is crafted from lightweight, durable anodized aluminum, and the Amp Jewel LED gives your pedalboard the classic Fender look. The switchable LED-backlit knobs show your control settings on a dark stage at a glance."},{itemId:"162",brand:"Electro Harmonix",model:"MEL9 Tape Replay",color:"White",price:"221.30",image:a("4bd6"),description:"The polyphonic MEL9 uses the same extraordinary technology as the B9, C9 and KEY9 to transform your axe and resurrect the sound of vintage tape-based keyboards.
